	<h1> Biography and Curriculum</h1>
	<h3> My story begins in Naples, one of the most beautiful cities in all of Italy.
	I was born on 02/13/2004 and I spent my first months of life in my birthplace to which I am very much due.
	In my first months I lived with my parents and my grandmother, one of the most important women in my life.
	At the age of 1 I moved to Rome, where I spent all my childhood, having a lot of fun with my friends but above all learning fundamental values such as dedication.
	Once I finished middle school, I started my high school path which is still continuing.
	This summer completely changed my life because i moved in Macedonian. I have the great opportunity to get an international diploma,
	that should be very important for my careere.
